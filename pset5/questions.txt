2.  Lossy compression uses inexact approximations (or partial data
    discarding) for representing the content that has been encoded,
    where lossless compression does not: it  allows the original data to
    be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.

4.  When the operating system erases a FAT file, two things occur.
    First, the system modifies the filename's first character in the file's
    directory entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the
    directory entry can be recycled. Second, the system moves all of the
    files's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters. The
    actual file data is never touched.
5.  One way to ensure with high probability that deleted files cannot be recovered
    consists in overwriting that data with other data so that the
    original data cannot be recovered
6.  The <stdint.h> header declares sets of integer types having
    specified widths, and defines corresponding sets of macros. It
    also defines macros that specify limits of integer types
    corresponding to types defined in other standard headers.
